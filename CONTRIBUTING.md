## Welcome
Thanks for your interest in contributing to this project. As you may have noticed, this project is currently in Beta, but for me this is the perfect opportunity to collect ideas on how to make a better infrastructure on plugin.

This is currently a one-person project but I'll try and respond as quickly as possible. Also, this project is my first foray into the wide world of open source, so please understand that if you find something obvious related to handling issues, pull requests and the like, it is probably because of my lack of experience with sharing code and open source in general. Thanks for your patience!
